_Sample code for controlling a 16-pin 8x8 single color LED grid_

h2. About

This code will demonstrate control of an LED grid with a few different demos.

When I received this 8x8 LED grid there was no documentation that made any sense.
I've written a blog post about how I reverse engineered the interface and made it work.
